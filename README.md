<h2>How I made this project?</h2>

<p>I collaborated with a friend who specializes in interior design. The motivation behind the project was to create a platform where designers could showcase their work, draw inspiration from others, and connect with potential clients. My role encompassed the end-to-end development of the platform.</p>

<p>I initiated the project using Next.js with TypeScript for the front end, coupled with Node.js and MongoDB for the backend, ensuring the incorporation of all essential features. As the project progressed, I stayed abreast of the latest technologies and, when Next.js introduced app routing and server actions, I promptly implemented these updates. This strategic move not only aligned with the project's goals but also contributed to cost reduction and improved overall performance, essential considerations for a startup.</p>

<p>Throughout the project, I played a pivotal role in shaping the technological framework and ensuring the seamless integration of new features. The collaborative effort resulted in a successful platform that not only met the initial requirements but also showcased adaptability to evolving technologies, underscoring the efficiency of our development approach.</p>
